# Pandora
Pandora's Box for PCA analyses. This tool is intended to quantify the uncertainty of PCA analyses. 
As the name suggests: there might be results surfacing that you don't like :-) 
Pandora estimates the uncertainty of PCA dimensionality reduction using bootstrap resampling on two levels: SNP level and individual level.
Pandora then reports the uncertainty on two levels:
**PCA level:** 
On a scale of 0 â€“ 1, how closely do the resampled PCAs match the PCA on the original data. 
0 is the worst possible score and 1 the best possible score where all bootstrapped PCAs are exactly identical to the original PCA.
The lower the score, the more careful you should be to draw conclusions based on the PCA of the data.
**Cluster level:**
Typically, a PCA analysis is followed by a clustering (usually using K-Means clustering) to determine e.g. population structures in the data.
Pandora estimates the uncertainty of the clustering using the bootstrapped PCAs and the TODO score. 
Again, the uncertainty is measured on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 being the worst possible score and 1 the best.

## How Pandora works:
### Bootstrapping:
Bootstrapping the original data is done on two levels independently: resampling the SNPs and resampling the individual sequences. 
Bootstrapping the SNPs is straightforward and has a clear interpretation. This is not the case for resampling the sequences.
TODO: describe how we resample the sequences and what this means (refer to the PCA Nature paper)

### PCA uncertainty
To measure the uncertainty of the dimensionality reduction, we compare the PCA of the original dataset (`original_pca`) to the PCA of each bootstrapped dataset (`bootstrapped_pca_i`) separately.
